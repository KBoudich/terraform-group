								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Navigation in website design does not undergo many changes. It includes almost the same elements, always meets the audience from the outset and modestly takes its place in the top header. Since the popularization of the&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/hamburger-mega-menus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hamburger</a>&nbsp;button, nothing earth-shattering has happened. However, this does not mean that its life is boring and uneventful.</p>



<p>As an integral element of the UI and a crucial part of good user experience, navigation never abstracts itself from design or distances from trending solutions. It always manages to blend in, but not get lost in the spectacle that awaits in the modern hero area.</p>



<p>Designers conduct various experiments to adapt it to new realms to come up with exciting solutions. And one such attempt to create navigation that meets the mainstream results in ultra-narrow, sticky vertical navbars.</p>



<p>We have already seen narrow sidebars. However, this time it differs a little bit.</p>



<p>The renewed version is more compact, minimal and elegant. It bets on popular features like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://speckyboy.com/going-up-vertical-lettering-in-web-design/" target="_blank">vertical lettering</a>. And most importantly, it sticks to the screen and follows the user through the website, complying with all the basic requirements of good navigation.  Let’s consider some representative examples.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.axmckinney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Austin McKinney</a></h2>



<p>Our first stop is the personal portfolio of Austin McKinney. Here, the vertical navbar includes only the essentials: a hamburger button, links to profiles in social media platforms, the name and occupation of the artist.</p>



<p>Thanks to its white, clean, and ultra-narrow design, it perfectly blends into an overall light environment with a powerful geometric vibe. It creates a necessary anchor for online visitors, providing them with helpful information.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stick-vertical-nav-01.png" alt="Example from Austin McKinney"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://editorialnew.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Editorial New</a></h2>



<p>The team behind Editorial New shows us that the solution is quite universal and works regardless of coloring, stylistic options or interactive details. What’s more, it is an ideal partner for websites that position themselves as online magazines.</p>



<p>Here the navbar includes just one element – the hamburger button. It opens a&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/slide-out-sidebars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slide-out</a>&nbsp;menu with a table of contents. Since it sticks to the left side of the screen, wherever users are on the page, they always have quick access to links in order to jump from one section to another.</p>



<p>Note, unlike the previous example, here the vertical navbar is a part of the perimeter navigation that makes the design look complete.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stick-vertical-nav-02.jpg" alt="Example from Editorial New"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://thecrowdfundingformula.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Crowdfunding Formula</a></h2>



<p>The vertical navbar of Crowdfunding Formula is located on the right side. Although we are not accustomed to seeing it there, nevertheless it works perfectly. What’s more, thanks to the contrasting orange color that marks the logotype, selected menu link, and search button, the sidebar naturally catches an eye.</p>



<p>Note, it does not have any borders: it just seamlessly flows into the design. However, thanks to the boxy vibe that runs throughout the page and generous amount of whitespace, it gets its own place under the sun.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stick-vertical-nav-03.jpg" alt="Example from The Crowdfunding Formula"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://www.nsdi.com.tw/#nsdiTop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NSDI</a></h2>



<p>The team behind NSDI uses a vertical navbar for displaying not just the hamburger button, but also pagination for a full-screen slider. Another distinctive feature is that all elements move with the user. Here, you can see an ultra-narrow vertical navbar and corner navigation that co-work together in order to create a comfortable user experience.</p>



<p>Much like in the case of The Crowdfunding Formula, here navigation does not have a distinctive background. However, the team has used contrasting colors to naturally set the elements off from the composition.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stick-vertical-nav-04.jpg" alt="Example from NSDI"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://www.cervelo.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cervelo Cycles</a></h2>



<p>Cervelo Cycles has a more-or-less traditional sidebar, though this fact does not stop it from looking trendy and refreshing. It covers all the menu links, logotype, search field and CTA. It is relatively wide and stands out from the content flow due to its solid black background.</p>



<p>Its key feature lies in a small transformation. The sidebar&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/code-morphing-svg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">morphs</a>&nbsp;into an ultra-narrow vertical line with everything hidden inside once the user starts to scroll down. The minimized version has only the hamburger button in the center. However, it is precisely what is needed for online visitors to avoid getting lost in the content-heavy environment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stick-vertical-nav-05.jpg" alt="Example from Cervelo Cycles"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://villacovri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Villa Covri</a></h2>



<p>The official website of Villa Corvi has not one but two ultra-narrow vertical navbars. The first one includes only social media links displayed in vertical rhythm, whereas the second one comprises the button to the inner menu and nameplate. Along with the upper header, these two strengthen the subtle boxy vibe of the website.</p>



<p>Note, only the right panel sticks to the screen and moves along with users. It transforms into a horizontal line on tablets and cellphones to create consistency across various devices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stick-vertical-nav-06.jpg" alt="Example from Villa Covri"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://co.tedyjd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TedCo</a></h2>



<p>There are two important takeaways from the official website of TedCo.</p>



<p>First, much like in the case of Editorial New, here the vertical navbar is a part of the corner navigation. It looks neat, elegant and informative. It finishes off the sophisticated design of UI.</p>



<p>Secondly, the path of exploring the website is unconventional. Instead of moving down, users scroll to the right along the X-axis. Here the vertical navbar stays where it is, giving users the necessary focal points to feel comfortable.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stick-vertical-nav-07.png" alt="Example from TedCo"/></figure>



<h2><a href="https://rogue.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rogue Studio</a></h2>



<p>The navbar in Rogue Studio is an excellent example of the solution where all the navigation links are exposed to the audience. On top of that, the creative team managed to gracefully include logotype and social media icons.</p>



<p>Although the component looks more cluttered in comparison to the previous ones, it has one significant advantage over them. It gives users what they need right here, right now without unnecessary moves.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/stick-vertical-nav-08.jpg" alt="Example from Rogue Studio"/></figure>



<h2>Reasons for Going Vertical</h2>



<p>Sometimes, we can see a designer’s exciting take on the main navigation that breathes new life into the component. Sticky vertical navbars are one of them. Even though they are not something brand-new, they feel refreshing.</p>



<p>There are several good reasons to use them. First of all, they are compact, serving as an ideal tool for those who want to use the entire hero area for entertaining. Secondly, their size is appropriate for the various small devices that dominate these days. Third, thanks to sticky positioning they are perfect assistants that make the user experience more comfortable.</p>



<p>And finally, continually displaying the logo or name of the artist is an easy way to enhance brand identity.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dealing with concerned clients can be a challenge for numerous reasons. I liken it to running around with a fire extinguisher, desperately trying to put out blazes large and small. But it’s not just the&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/calming-panicky-design-client/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">panicky ones</a>&nbsp;who need the occasional dousing. And it’s not necessarily their fault.</p>



<p>The web can be a scary place – even for seasoned designers. Trying to wrap our heads around privacy issues,&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/tips-secure-wordpress-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">security</a>, accessibility and new technologies can make anyone’s head spin. So, just think of what they can do to the people who depend on us for help.</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s even worse for our clients. Why? Because there are any number of bad actors out there who are constantly trying to trick them, hack their site or otherwise extort a few extra dollars. Not to mention the perfectly legitimate things that, while innocent enough, can put a non-techie into a cold sweat.</p>



<p>With that in mind, here are a few items that tend to put even cool clients into panic mode. But don’t worry. Each one includes some tips for talking them off the emotional ledge.</p>



<h2>Mysterious Spam Invoices</h2>



<p>If you own a website, or even a domain, odds are you’re going to start receiving all manner of nuisance messages. Whether they appear in your&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/grumpy-designer-email/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inbox</a>&nbsp;or your postal mail, their aim is to get you to spend money – often out of fear.</p>



<p>One of the more famous examples of this are phony domain registration renewals. A company (if you can call it that) will send a letter that looks like an invoice, claiming the client’s domain name is about to expire. It will probably mention all the terrible things that can happen if they don’t renew this instant. And, oh yeah, the cost is massively marked up.</p>



<p>The only trouble is that your client has never heard of this company. So naturally, they’ll ask you about it. They may wonder if they’ve missed the deadline and why the price is suddenly higher. Have they already lost the domain? What will happen to their business?</p>



<p>Honorable mention goes out to those great “let me fix your website” emails that show up regularly. But they’re only&nbsp;<em>kind of</em>&nbsp;scary.</p>



<h4>What to Do</h4>



<p>When your client comes to you with a scam message, tell them so. But also tell them, if necessary, who their domain registrar is and why it’s important to have that information on file. It’s a great chance to educate them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/scared-clients-01.jpg" alt="Man looking at a laptop computer."/></figure>



<h2>Red Alerts from Google Search Console</h2>



<p>No, it’s not just spam that gets a client’s heart racing. The emails sent out by Google Search Console can be even more frightening.</p>



<p>The search/email/operating system/home device/phone/world-dominating giant has been known to inundate our inboxes with all sorts of “helpful” messages about our websites. Sometimes it thinks buttons are too close together or text is too small. In other instances, it complains about missing attributes within breadcrumb links.</p>



<p>That’s not to say these messages can’t point out some legitimate website issues. But often, it’s more likely to cause the recipient to worry about something that is realistically harmless. Worse yet, it gets forwarded to a web designer, who suddenly needs another glass of wine.</p>



<h4>What to Do</h4>



<p>Whatever rubbish&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/googles-dominance-on-the-web-20-years-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google</a>&nbsp;sends, it should still be looked into – just in case. Still, it’s worth mentioning that these messages need to be taken with a grain of salt. Clients shouldn’t worry that their site won’t be indexed or that they’re somehow being punished by an algorithm.</p>



<p>Let them know that Google’s automated tools can often focus on the minutiae. And, while you’ll be glad to review the issue, it most likely isn’t a major concern.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/scared-clients-02.jpg" alt="Google sign."/></figure>



<h2>The Cache Trap</h2>



<p>Raise your hand if you’ve ever had a client request a change, which you make, and receive a message back stating that they “can’t see it”.</p>



<p>Even though&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;can’t see you (Google probably&nbsp;<em>can</em>, though), I’d expect many hands to be in the air. That’s because “cache panic” is probably as old as web design itself. For years, it’s been a game of cat-and-mouse where we attempt to help our clients clear out browser cache – a sometimes&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/tips-for-working-with-technophobes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">painful</a>&nbsp;experience.</p>



<p>I mention this because it seems to be more prevalent than ever with certain website configurations. Managed WordPress hosting services have been particularly difficult in this area. With some, it’s not just browser-based cache, we also need to worry about server-based as well. The result is a lot of wasted time, trying to get everyone on the same page.</p>



<h4>What to Do</h4>



<p>First, get a stress ball. Next, teach your clients about the wonders of cache and how they can clear it from their browser. In most cases, that will do the trick.</p>



<p>If you find that your web host has tough-to-clear server cache, it may be worth trying a&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/wordpress-staging-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staging environment</a>. This would allow you to make changes on a non-cached location, while enabling your clients to see updates before you push them to production.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/scared-clients-03.jpg" alt="Woman typing."/></figure>



<h2>Shapeshifting Tools</h2>



<p>Change is difficult – especially when it comes to software. And it seems like, just when we find a comfortable routine, it all gets blown up by what vendors like to call “UI enhancements”.</p>



<p>This can really throw a monkey wrench into the lives of clients who update their own website. After all, they’re not web designers and don’t have time or interest in keeping up with the industry. They simply wake up one day, log into their website and find that their whole process is turned upside down.</p>



<p>The most recent example of this is the WordPress&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/gutenberg-wordpress-block-editor-first-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gutenberg block editor</a>. It looks and functions quite differently from the old Classic Editor. Not to mention that early versions lacked the polish we see today.</p>



<p>This led to a lot of confusion, frustration and, yes, even a little fear that things would break.</p>



<h4>What to Do</h4>



<p>Frankly, it often falls on designers to stay ahead of the game with these kinds of changes. If we see major developments coming along to the sites we manage, we should act to make the transition as smooth as possible (or delay it indefinitely).</p>



<p>In the case of Gutenberg, that meant educating clients about the new editor. And, in some cases, perhaps installing the Classic Editor to keep the status quo. It’s all about minimizing discomfort.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/scared-clients-04.jpg" alt="WordPress new post link."/></figure>



<h2>Web Designers: Lifting the Fog of Fear</h2>



<p>It seems like just about every day, there’s something to put a scare into our clients. Whether it’s a crafty scammer, a nitpicking search giant or advancements in technology – we web designers are bound to be&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/questions-grumpy-designer-cant-answer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a>&nbsp;about it.</p>



<p>Certainly, having to calmly explain these situations can become tiring. There is no shortage of other things on our to-do lists. But on the bright side, it can be very satisfying to help clear up misconceptions and bring even a tiny level of comfort to someone else.</p>



<p>That in itself is a reward and it also helps to build a high level of trust between designer and client. And, looking like a superhero isn’t so bad, either.</p>

<p>We talk about it all the time. Being a web designer is about more than just clean code and pretty graphics. There are a number of other roles we play. Psychiatrist, psychic, support technician and all-around guru come to mind.</p>



<p>Part of our relationship with clients also involves sharing knowledge and gently prodding them to move in the right direction. That makes us motivational speakers/life coaches, maybe?</p>



<p>Regardless of what we call it, the action itself is vitally important. Because the web is constantly changing, designers are often an invaluable resource for clients.</p>



<p>We are a liaison that keeps them abreast of new developments that can have a direct impact on their business. This is especially so when it comes to smaller businesses that don’t have the resources to keep up on their own.</p>



<p>In that tradition, the following are some key areas where we can proactively fill in those knowledge gaps for our clients and some tips for doing so.</p>



<h2>Accessibility</h2>



<p>Those of us in the web design industry have been talking about the importance of&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/web-design-challenges-accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accessibility</a>&nbsp;for years. However, clients have tended to show varying degrees of interest. In some cases, it feels like you could be shouting the message through a bullhorn and get a mere shrug in return.</p>



<p>Yet, this issue isn’t going away. Quite the opposite. Accessibility concerns haven’t been covered that much by the mainstream media. That is, until the now-infamous&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/accessibility-the-future-and-why-dominos-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Domino’s Pizza case</a>. It shows that companies can face legal (hence, financial) consequences for failing to accommodate all users.</p>



<p>This serves as an especially loud wakeup call in the United States, which has yet to enact any concrete rules regarding website accessibility.</p>



<p>It’s something clients need to know about. Whether approached one-by-one or through mass communication, there is an opportunity to get any stragglers on board. At the very least, we can make them better aware of what’s happening and what&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/web-accessibility-101/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">steps</a>&nbsp;can be taken to address any shortcomings.</p>



<p>Aspects such as typography, color contrast and keyboard navigation are often fairly simple to tweak and go a long way towards more user-centric design. Plus, reinforcing good habits like setting ALT tags on images should also be emphasized.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/proactive-subjects-01.jpg" alt="A handicap parking space."/></figure>



<h2>Privacy</h2>



<p>Here’s another area where clients really need a helping hand. Unlike accessibility, privacy concerns really are all over the news. And regulations such as&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/gdpr-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDPR</a>&nbsp;again mean that real consequences can come from missteps.</p>



<p>Just about every website is collecting&nbsp;<em>something</em>. Tying in with virtually any&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/web-design-third-party-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party</a>&nbsp;service provider means cookies and user tracking scripts will likely be in place. Not to mention the everyday server logging that most sites employ. Therefore, privacy policies and procedures to back them up need to be in place.</p>



<p>Obviously, web designers are not legal experts. So, while we can’t (and shouldn’t) be the sole provider of advice, we can certainly play the role of helpful messenger.</p>



<p>How does that play out? You might consider reaching out to your clients and explaining the issues at hand. Provide some links to related articles – especially those that demonstrate the seriousness of keeping user data private. Finally, encourage them to seek legal counsel on the matter and be proactive themselves.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/proactive-subjects-02.jpg" alt="A sign that reads &quot;PRIVATE&quot;."/></figure>



<h2>Security</h2>



<p>The web is simply teeming with security risks. Virtually every user is vulnerable in some way. The same goes for websites.</p>



<p>A hacked site can become infected with malware. That, in turn, makes the site potentially unsafe for users. Beyond that, it can destroy carefully-crafted SEO strategies and leak customer data.</p>



<p>Many clients just assume that it’s our job to&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/whack-a-mole-wordpress-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handle</a>&nbsp;this stuff. And while that’s technically true, they also have a major role to play in keeping things safe.</p>



<p>Designers can help guide clients towards implementing secure practices. Things like using strong passwords and not sharing them with just anyone. In addition, teaching a healthy skepticism of email scams and even any third-party software they want to install.</p>



<p>As they say, security is only as good as its weakest link. In some cases that can be a careless client. But this is something we can help to prevent. As such, it’s worth the time and effort to help them understand their own responsibilities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/proactive-subjects-03.jpg" alt="Padlocks on a fence."/></figure>



<h2>Knowing Where to Draw the Line</h2>



<p>All of the subjects above are not only important, they are also linked to some serious repercussions. For web designers, this means walking a bit of a fine line.</p>



<p>On one hand, there is a sense of duty that goes along with informing our clients about these issues. That’s what being proactive is all about – trying to call attention to problems before they become even bigger ones.</p>



<p>At the same time, there is a danger in taking on too much responsibility in any one of these areas. It’s one thing to fix some known accessibility problems with a client’s website. But it’s another to certify (without being qualified to do so) that their site is&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/free-wordpress-plugins-legal-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compliant</a>. If the opposite is found to be true it can become a real nightmare.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s important to make your intentions and limitations clearly known. Let clients know that you can provide advice on a given topic, but that it’s best to speak with a legal expert where appropriate. You don’t want to leave yourself vulnerable should something go wrong.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/proactive-subjects-04.jpg" alt="People having a conversation."/></figure>



<h2>The Benefits of Speaking Up</h2>



<p>Quite often, our clients are busy. They’re wrapped up in their own daily grind and don’t necessarily have the time to focus on the intricacies of their website. So, don’t be too surprised if they don’t have a vast knowledge of accessibility, privacy or security best practices.</p>



<p>Web designers, however, are in a position to keep clients informed. And we have perhaps even a moral and&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/ethical-freelance-web-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ethical</a>&nbsp;obligation to do so.</p>



<p>Helping others avoid potential problems feels great. Plus, there is the possibility of generating some revenue from these discussions as well. In all, it’s a win-win situation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Not all website design gigs are created equally. The truth is that they will all vary in terms of compensation, scope and the overall experience you have.</p>



<p>But just about every project provides you with&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;type of benefit. They aren’t always monetary. And they aren’t necessarily obvious – at least not right away. It may require you to look back after the fact to find out exactly what you gained.</p>



<p>In that spirit, let’s take a look at some hidden gems that can come out of a web design project.</p>



<h2>Niche Knowledge</h2>



<p>It seems like every website you build has an unexpected challenge along the way. There’s always that one bit of functionality or design element that (temporarily, at least) derails your entire schedule. Nothing else gets done until the problem is solved.</p>



<p>eCommerce websites are famous for this. Clients tend to want their shopping cart to do something that goes against the grain. It&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/myth-simple-ecommerce-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complicates</a>&nbsp;and frustrates. But eventually, you find the right solution.</p>



<p>At the time, it’s easy to move on and assume that you’ll never have to deal with that issue again. But these things have a funny way of randomly popping up in other projects. Perhaps a new client saw what you had done for someone else, or they had an idea that was similar enough to a feature you implemented in the past.</p>



<p>The experience you gained the first time around can be invaluable. Even if you aren’t tasked with that exact same challenge again, a past struggle may provide just the insight you need. It will give you a solid foundation that you can use to navigate that next obstacle a little more smoothly.</p>



<h2>A Boost in Confidence</h2>



<p>Confidence can be a fleeting thing. One moment you have loads of it – but it might leave just as quickly. The right project may be just the thing you need to get your groove back.</p>



<p>The great thing is that this can happen in any number of ways. Hearing (or reading) some praise from a client after a successful launch certainly provides a boost. But it’s often the little things that offer an unexpected good feeling.</p>



<p>Things like experimenting with a new design technique or writing a piece of code that does something cool are prime examples. Sometimes, it’s just a matter of surprising yourself and feeling that sense of pride in your work. And it’s a feeling that you can achieve again and again as a project moves forward.</p>



<p>Much like the niche knowledge we mentioned above, the experience itself is also rewarding. You can think back to what you’ve accomplished anytime you need some positive vibes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hidden-project-benefits-02.jpg" alt="Man wearing a blue suit."/></figure>



<h2>Discovering What You Do (And Don’t) Like</h2>



<p>You’ll work on a number of website projects in your career. They may span a variety of industries and price points – not to mention all the different looks and functionality that go with them. Then, there are the personalities of those you work with.</p>



<p>Each one provides a different experience. And, over time, you’ll develop a sense of where your “sweet spot” lies. These are the types of projects that bring you&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/joys-of-web-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joy</a>. Along with that goes the price range and technical requirements that you feel comfortable working within. In addition, you will also develop a preference for the clients you work with and even the processes behind how you work with them.</p>



<p>On the other side of the coin are the projects and people that you want to avoid. This is equally important as you don’t want to become stuck in a bad situation.</p>



<p>There is a certain freedom in knowing the types of projects you want. This enables you to bring a higher level of focus to your business. It can even lead to better project outcomes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hidden-project-benefits-03.jpg" alt="A wall with the words &quot;Live, Work, Create&quot; painted on it."/></figure>



<h2>Relationships</h2>



<p>Finally, among the biggest potential benefits of any website project are the&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/relationship-building-not-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relationships</a>&nbsp;you gain. They are vital for keeping your business going strong over the long term.</p>



<p>The most immediate payoff is that a good working relationship often leads to repeat business. That client will come back to you for maintenance, redesigns and maybe even another new website or two down the line.</p>



<p>And, because they’re satisfied customers, they might even help you find new clients. Referrals are a huge bonus, as they get your foot in the door with a&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/build-great-reputation-freelancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great reputation</a>&nbsp;already in hand.</p>



<p>Plus, regular referrals can do wonders for the stability of your business. It means you can concentrate on the work itself, rather than wrangling new gigs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hidden-project-benefits-04.jpg" alt="Woman speaking."/></figure>



<h2>Money Isn’t Everything</h2>



<p>Virtually every web designer is hoping to reap financial reward from each project. After all, we have rent to pay, too.</p>



<p>But money alone can be a short-term benefit. Once you’ve spent it, then what?</p>



<p>It’s those lesser-known perks that are the real drivers of growth. Gaining the right kind of experience and relationships will help you&nbsp;<a href="https://speckyboy.com/adjusting-larger-web-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">move up</a>&nbsp;the ladder more than cashflow alone. They take time to accumulate, but are more than worth the wait.</p>

<html><h1>Online Editor to Change the Look of Your SVGs</h1>,SVG has been rapidly increasing in popularity, with SVG icons, fonts, inline SVG, SVG styling, and JS/CSS3 animation of SVGs. All great examples of smart SVG use. Aside from its responsiveness and animation features, SVG can take design to a whole new level.,
,Using a newly-developed editor, we&rsquo;ll show you how any vector can be made customizable. The editor is still experimental, so it cannot be integrated here, but we&rsquo;ll walk you through the process and illustrate this post with a sporty little swimmer (credit for the design goes to ,Lisandro Trepeu,).,
,1.Draw your vector,
,The first step is to design your illustration in your favorite graphical editor.,
,
,2.Export as SVG,
,Once you&rsquo;re done, you&rsquo;ll need to save your illustration as an ,SVG,.,
,You can keep the export settings to the standard SVG 1.1 format. The only setting that will affect the way you work with your SVG is &ldquo;CSS Properties&rdquo;. You have two options: you can either select &ldquo;style elements&rdquo; (which will add CSS classes on top of your SVG) or you can choose &ldquo;style attributes&rdquo; (to style each element separately). The choice depends mainly on how you&rsquo;ve built up your design and how you want to link variables to it.,
,You can then open your .svg file using a code/text editor to see what&rsquo;s inside:,
,
,A good exercise is to try to identify elements of your design by looking at the code. In our case, the elements are pretty easy to find with only ,&lt;path&gt;, elements and id&rsquo;s (names are automatically taken from the layers): swimsuit, goggles and cap.,
,Once we&rsquo;ve pasted the code into our text editor, you&rsquo;ll notice a &ldquo;clean SVG&rdquo; button in the upper right corner. This button was added to automatically remove useless metadata and prepare your SVG for customization (it&rsquo;s based on ,SVGO,). The way your SVG appears on screen depends on the original artboard in your graphical editor. If it doesn&rsquo;t display well, you can still adjust the viewbox values: ,viewBox=&quot;0 0 1024 1024&quot;,.,
,3. Style your SVG,
,Now you&rsquo;re ready for the actual customization. The good news is that you can style pretty much anything in your illustration from color to text, position and visibility.,
,Let&rsquo;s turn Michael into a Speckyboy swimmer. To do so, we&rsquo;ll change several things:,
,
,Change the color of the swimsuit, glasses and logo from purple to #587898 blue;,
,Hide the swimming goggles;,
,Put &ldquo;Speckyboy&rdquo; on his swim cap,
,
,This will be done inside the editor, so we need UX controls to interact with our mouse: we&rsquo;ll simply add a color picker, a boolean, and a text input.,
,The editor to style the SVG is right next to the SVG and is called CSS, because of it&rsquo;s similarities with its HTML counterpart.,
,
,Elements from the SVG need to be linked to the UX controls to make them customizable. As with most styling languages, this comprises two steps:,
,
,Selecting the ID element using # (e.g. #hat1) (or alternatively using classes);,
,Applying a method to the element (e.g. &lsquo;fill&rsquo;, &lsquo;visible&rsquo; or &lsquo;text-content&rsquo;);,
,
,The ,$name, is a reference to the UX control we have defined above.,
,The controls should now be linked to the illustration and you should be able to customize the illustration. Here&rsquo;s our Speckyboy Swimmer:,
,
,You can find the full customization code and play with the Speckyboy swimmer here.,
,The tutorial above can be done for any vector image. You can get access to the editor and illustrio platform here.,
